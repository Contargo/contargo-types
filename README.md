Contargo Types
===============

This is a library aimed at providing a collection of re-usable Contargo objects.

## Getting started

Using the `contargo-types` as a library in your project, means simply including
it as a Maven dependency:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>net.contargo</groupId>
      <artifactId>contargo-types</artifactId>
      <version>LATEST</version>
    </dependency>

## Development

This is a pretty straight-forward Java-project, use `mvn` to build, test and
deploy.

Happy hacking!
